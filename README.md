This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
We all know that our CURRENT BANKING face some issues such as: 

✅ High transaction fee. 

✅ Double spending as a difficulty of sending money twice. 

✅ Hacking by having unauthorized access to the data. 

One of the most secure way is called BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY that is a decentralized system of secure and trusted distributed databases, which records and shares the transaction details across many nodes (ex: computer) so that the data can not be modified. 
On BLOCKCHAIN we have: 

✅ Decentralized system, where there is not third party between the receiver and the sender.

✅ Verification of transaction. 

✅ Public ledger, where all the transactions are recording and accessible by everyone on the system. 

Let’s see how it works with my Web 3.0 App Called SingoCript
